# SRCNN
The project is reproduction of the paper *Learning a Deep Convolutional Network for Image Super-Resolutionã€‹(ECCV 2014)* by Pytorch.
## Requirement
Some Matlab codes provided by the paper author, url: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/FSRCNN.html.  
There are some captions for how to use that official codes to do data-preprocessing and testing in corresponding files.  
## Dependence
Matlab 2016  
Pytorch 1.0.0  
## Usage
Use generate_train.m to generate train.h5.  
Train by train.py:
```
python train.py
```
Convert the Pytorch model .pkl to Matlab matrix .mat.  
```
python convert.py
```
Use get_result.m to get the PSNR result and reconstruction RGB images.
